## **Project Proposal**

### **Website Concept**
Flinders Uni Skill Share (FUSS) is a web-based platform that enables Flinders University students to exchange skills, services, and time without the need for money. Students earn "FUSSCredits" by providing services such as tutoring, essay proofreading, moving assistance, or language practice. They can then spend these credits to request help from other students. The purpose of the platform is to build a supportive campus community where students can rely on each others diverse abilities, reduce financial barriers, and encourage collaboration. 

### **Target Audience Profile**
The Primary target audience for FUSS includes
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- Undergraduate students: Often require academic support such as tutoring or essasy proofreading. These students may look for social conncections which are vital in maintaining a healthy university work-life balance. These students may be seeking more help for mentoring and essay-reviewing services.
- International students: May seek language exchange and learning opportunities, cultural support, or practical help with daily tasks. These students may also be seeking help via mentoring or essay-reviewing services.
- Senior Students (Final-Year): May be looking for mentoring and tutoring opportunities and networking opportunities. Senior Students would be more comfortable and confident with their skillset and have been at the university for a while. Because of this, these students may feel more comfortable offering their skillsets.
- Student clubs and societies: Would be looking for ways to advertise to new students to join the club, as well as event support. These clubs and societies may also be seeking help and request volunteers.
- Administrators: Responsible for overseeing system activity, moderating content, managing students. These Administrators (Admins) would be staff, such as topic coordinators or lecturers.

### **Scope Statement**
The proposed website will include the following features:
- Student Registration and Profile Management: Secure Login via Multifactor Authentication. The user will log in with an email and a password, and an authentication email would be sent. Once the user has verified via email, the user will then have access to their account.
- Skills offered and Requested: Categorized skill library with a smart search using filters. This will allow browsing to be intuitive and inclusive of all technological skill-types. The website will have categories (e.g. academic), skill names (e.g. python programming), text-box descriptions and time avaliable boxes.
- FUSSCredit System: A visual representation to allow users to track their current balances and record transactions with timestamps and details. The user is able to track the credits that they have earnt and the credits that they have spent.
- Service Request and Negotiation: Request services, Specify time/date, Accept/Decline etc. These services will be able to sync with a calendar to ensure a streamlined organisation and notifications to remind users of upcoming services. 
- Peer Review System: Students leave ratings and short reviews after service completion. This will be able to build trust and accountability between service providers (tutoring, report reviewing, etc.) to encourage the providers to do their best and for students to search the reviews for a provider that would be best fitted to their needs.
- Internal Messaging: Coordinate requests and communicaiton between students. This would include a real-time chatlog with reciepts, as well as file sharing (such as essays, images, etc.). This will keep communication between students centralized and recorded and allow for efficient delivery and understanding of services.
- Admin Dashboard: Moderation tools, allowing administrative users that have access to the admin dashboard to suspend students, edit student accounts and delete student accounts. Users of the Admin Dashboard will be able to see active students, active services, total credits and week transitions. The admin user will also be able to adjust the credit balance, requiring the number of credits to adjust, the reason (e.g. reward) and a text-box description for further information.
