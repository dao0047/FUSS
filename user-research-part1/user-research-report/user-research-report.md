## **Research Methods**

The research approach for the Flinders Uni Skill Share (FUSS) project was based on secondary sources and comparative analysis, rather than primary surveys or interviews. This decision reflects the substantial body of existing literature on student behaviour, peer learning, time-banking systems, and online trust, which provides a strong foundation for identifying user needs and shaping the design of the platform.

Research into time-banking demonstrates the value of reciprocal exchange systems in fostering inclusion and community engagement. Seyfang (2003) shows that time banks promote equality by recognising all skills as having value, while Gregory (2012) highlights their capacity to empower young participants through reciprocal learning. These findings directly influenced the decision to implement FUSS’s credit system, in which one hour of service equates to one FUSSCredit, ensuring fairness and inclusivity across both academic and non-academic services.

Peer-to-peer learning in higher education has also been shown to provide significant academic and social benefits. García-Molina et al. (2024) found that peer tutoring enhances student outcomes, confidence, and motivation, while Colvin and Ashman (2010) demonstrated its value in improving persistence and retention, particularly among students from underrepresented backgrounds. These insights reinforce the importance of designing FUSS as a dual system, allowing students to both offer and request academic and practical skills, thus broadening its value beyond traditional tutoring models.

Financial pressures remain a consistent challenge for students in higher education. Universities Australia (2022) and Devlin et al. (2012) both report widespread financial strain among students, which influences their participation and wellbeing. This evidence directly supports FUSS’s non-monetary model, which removes financial barriers to support by using credits rather than cash, making the system accessible to all students regardless of their economic circumstances.

Research into student technology use also informed the platform’s technical requirements. Pew Research Center (2018) highlights students’ reliance on smartphones for communication and scheduling, while Miyazaki and Ideta (2020) emphasise the role of trust and identity verification in encouraging participation in online communities. Together, these findings shaped FUSS’s mobile-first design, with features such as push notifications, availability filters, and secure access restricted to Flinders University email addresses.

In combination, these sources provide a robust foundation for the FUSS design. They demonstrate that a credit-based, mobile-responsive, student-only platform not only meets practical needs but also promotes inclusivity, safety, and community connection within the university environment.

## **Competitor Analysis**

To assess the value of FUSS, it is important to compare it with existing platforms that address similar needs. While these systems provide useful benchmarks, they also reveal gaps that FUSS is designed to overcome.

Airtasker is a large-scale platform where individuals exchange services. Its main strength is flexibility and an established review system that helps build trust. However, Airtasker operates entirely through monetary transactions, which can exclude students facing financial pressures. By contrast, FUSS uses a credit-based model, eliminating financial barriers and ensuring equity of access. Furthermore, Airtasker lacks a university-specific community focus, whereas FUSS is restricted to Flinders students, promoting safety and peer connection.

Gumtree Services offers a free platform where users advertise services such as tutoring or odd jobs. Its accessibility is an advantage, but it provides minimal trust and safety features, leaving users vulnerable to scams or unreliable providers. FUSS directly addresses this weakness by requiring university email verification and offering peer reviews, creating a safer and more accountable environment tailored to students.

Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) represent a structured, university-run approach to peer tutoring. PASS is highly trusted, with research showing improved student outcomes and retention (Colvin & Ashman, 2010; García-Molina et al., 2024). At Flinders, PASS has been shown to improve engagement and reduce failure rates (Burke da Silva & Auburn, 2009). However, PASS is limited to academic support and bound by institutional timetables, which restricts flexibility. FUSS expands on this model by including both academic and practical skills, while allowing students to negotiate times directly with peers. This ensures flexibility and a great variety of support not found in traditional programs.

In summary, student financial pressures, high digital engagement, and the proven benefits of peer-to-peer learning highlight the need for a platform such as FUSS. Unlike existing alternatives, FUSS directly addresses gaps in inclusivity, flexibility, and trust by providing a credit-based, mobile-first, student-only environment. Grounded in robust research and informed by detailed user personas, this proposal demonstrates both feasibility and innovation, ensuring that FUSS meets immediate student needs while also strengthening community connection and long-term student wellbeing at Flinders University.
